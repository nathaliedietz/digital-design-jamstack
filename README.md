# A Next.js starter for Lego Digital Design Project

## Usage

### Getting started

To start your project, either:

1. Deploy to Netlify using the button above, or
2. Clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will take some time and will install all packages necessary to run the starter.

### Development

While developing your website, use:

```bash
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/ to preview your new website. The Next.js development server will automatically reload the CSS or refresh the whole page, when stylesheets or content changes.

### Static build

To build a static version of the website inside the `/dist` folder, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

See [package.json](package.json) for all tasks.
